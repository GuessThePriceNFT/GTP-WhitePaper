GTP (Guess The Price) WhitePaper

1) What is GTP?

GTP is a project that transforms the prices of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana into NFTs. The goal of this project is to create an ecosystem that not only enables NFT holders to generate income but also builds a strong community. GTP offers an innovative approach to the crypto world through its reward mechanism and minting processes.

2) How Does It Work?

GTP categorizes crypto prices into specific ranges to create unique NFTs. For example, Bitcoin prices are categorized into ranges of 5000 units and assigned to NFTs:

0-5000, 5000-10000, 10000-15000, ... 195000-200000, 200000 and above.

A total of 50 unique NFT classes are created, each containing 200 NFTs. 80% of the minting fee is allocated to the reward pool, while the remaining 20% is distributed to MagicEden and the project team. After the minting process, NFTs generate earnings based on a randomly selected Bitcoin price on a specific date.

Distribution Mechanism

80% of the minting fee is redistributed to community members.

MagicEden receives 10% of the minting fee.

The remaining 10% is allocated to the project team and volunteers.

Proceeds from sales on MagicEden are also redistributed to NFT holders.

Airdrop and Rarity System

Airdrops are conducted on different dates each month, and NFT holders who correctly predict the price range are rewarded. The rarity system is determined based on price ranges due to the continuous fluctuations in Bitcoin prices.

Important Note:

The GTP system does not aim to generate profit; the only winners are the NFT holders.

3) Reward Distribution Mechanism

Rewards are divided into three different tiers:

S Tier: Distributed to NFTs within the exact price range of Bitcoin.

A Tier: Distributed to NFTs within the two adjacent ranges of the S Tier.

B Tier: Distributed to NFTs within the two adjacent ranges of the A Tier.

Example:

If the randomly selected Bitcoin price on a specific date is 99,000:

S Tier: NFTs in the 95K-100K range.

A Tier: NFTs in the 90K-95K and 100K-105K ranges.

B Tier: NFTs in the 85K-90K and 105K-110K ranges.

Distribution Percentages:

S Tier: 60% of the 80% minting fee.

A Tier: 30% of the 80% minting fee.

B Tier: 10% of the 80% minting fee.

Per NFT Earnings:

With 200 NFTs in each class:

S Tier: (192,000 / 200) = 960 USD

A Tier: (96,000 / 400) = 240 USD

B Tier: (32,000 / 400) = 80 USD

4) Roadmap

The project consists of three main phases:

Phase 1: Bitcoin GuessThePrice

Blockchain: Base chain

Timeline: Q1 2024

Goal: Launch the first NFT series based on Bitcoin prices.

Phase 2: Ethereum GuessThePrice

Blockchain: Arbitrum chain

Timeline: Q2 2024

Goal: Launch the NFT series based on Ethereum prices.

Phase 3: Solana GuessThePrice

Blockchain: Solana chain

Timeline: Q3 2024

Goal: Launch the NFT series based on Solana prices.

This roadmap aims to enhance the sustainability of the project and reach a broader user base across different networks.

5) Events and Additional Rewards

The GTP project will organize events to increase community engagement and diversify rewards. The airdrop system offers additional opportunities for traders and ecosystems. As the project progresses, new reward mechanisms and functionalities will be developed based on community feedback.

Conclusion

GTP aims to establish an innovative NFT ecosystem in the crypto world, enabling community members to generate income while promoting the use of blockchain technology. With a sustainable reward mechanism and a community-focused approach, GTP is a project that targets long-term success.
